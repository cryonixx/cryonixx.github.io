                Welcome to my little corner of the internet!! I absolutely adore
                personal websites, so I thought why not take a crack at it too?
                This website serves as my personal little space where I can
                freely show my creations, show cool stuff I like, and more
                importantly, as a portfolio. Feel free to look around!! You
                might find something interesting and fun ^__^ Enjoy your stay!
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                As you can see, this site is still empty; I have yet to actually
                place my works and such. For now, you can have my links and
                current status in different platforms.
            </p>
