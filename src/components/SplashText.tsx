                Welcome to my little corner of the internet!! I absolutely adore
                personal websites, so I thought why not take a crack at it too?
                This website serves as my personal little space where I can
                freely show my creations, show cool stuff I like, and more
                importantly, as a portfolio. Feel free to look around!! You
                might find something interesting and fun ^__^ Enjoy your stay~
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                As you can see, this site is still empty; I have yet to actually
                place my works and such. This is still under heavy construction
                and it will forever be lmao. For now, this window will be the
                only thing you'll see until I stop dilly-dallying around. See ya
                later!
                <br></br>
