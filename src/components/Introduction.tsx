                It's ya local gremlin here; call me danika or cryonix (or ix for
                short)!! I am currently a college student pursuing Computer
                Science with Specialization in Machine Learning. I make 3D
                Models, code, and I like to do random stuff that I find
                interesting and fun, which I will soon place in this site. I'm
                still in the middle of figuring out how to un-spaghettify my
                code here, as I have no idea what I'm doing. (probably might
                also need to make more stuff to put in here as well ;-;)
            </p>
